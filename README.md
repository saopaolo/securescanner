# securescanner
python that queries OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy) to find vulnerabilities in web applications when a "URL" is defined?

Instructions:

    Start OWASP ZAP: Ensure that OWASP ZAP is running and accessible at the specified URL.
    API Key: Replace 'your_api_key' with your actual API key from ZAP (if you have set one).
    Target URL: Change TARGET_URL to the URL you want to scan.
    Run the script: Execute the Python script to start the scan.

Note:

    Ensure that you have permission to scan the target URL to avoid legal issues.
    You may need to adjust the script depending on the version of ZAP you are using. Check the ZAP API documentation for additional options and details.
